# engcode - binary2english

## Motivation
Words, even unfamiliar ones, are easier to remember than numbers or cryptic strings.

## Algorithm
Each word represents its 0-based index in the alphabetically ordered word list.
Assuming that the word list has 2^k entries, encoding binary data can
be done as follows:

- Break the input into groups of k bits.
- Interpret each group as an unsigned k-bit integer where the most significant
bit is the first one. Lets denote this value n.
- Output nth word from the word list.

Decoding is similar:

- For each word in the input, find its position in the word list
- Encode it as an unsigned k-bit integer (MSB first again)
- Concatenate values from all groups

Implementations of the described procedures for k=18 are in `engcode.py`
and `engdecode.py`. In the case of k=18, 9 bytes can be encoded
using 4 words. There is a much more
efficient encoder implemented in `engcode.c` that uses this fact.
Decoding could also be implemented faster, for example using a precalculated
prefix trie of words with their numbers in leaves.

### The bits left over
If the number of bits to be encoded is not divisble by k, the missing
at the end are assumed to be `0`. This means that encodings of `0b1` and
`0b10` are indistinguishable. To avoid this, one could either transmit the length separately or use a padding scheme as for block ciphers.

## The word list
Based on Yet Another Word List by Mendel Cooper and Alan Beale from
12-Oct-2008, a list of 2^18 words was generated by
selecting 2^18 shortest words and breaking the ties in favor of
including words earlier in the alphabetical ordering. The resulting list
starts with words `aa` and `aah`, ends with `zyzzyvas` and `zzz` and
when delimited with newlines has an MD5 checksum of
`4e0766283a0b1892b2ecbc28691e64b7`. The script used is `prepare.sh`.

## Legal...
Yet Another Word List was released to the public domain and so is the
derived list and this specification. The code accompanying it is GPL3.
